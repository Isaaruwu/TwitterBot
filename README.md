## TwitterBot
First ever python project. This project uses tweepy and my personnal twitter account to reply when tagged with a specific '#'. The bot also returns custom replies to 2 specific users. The code template I used is from CS DOJO and I modified it to fit my needs. 

### How to use
#### Login info
First you need to upgrade your Twitter account to obtain dev features. 
Then enter your dev keys in the OAUTH.py file. 

#### Custom replies
You can change the custom replies by modifying the strings in the lines 41-50.
